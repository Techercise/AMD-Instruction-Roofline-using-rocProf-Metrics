# AMD-Instruction-Roofline-using-rocProf-Metrics
This repository contains example spreadsheets and scripts to construct instruction roofline models for AMD GPUs using metrics from [rocProf](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/rocprofiler)

The Python files in this repository come from the [NERSC Roofline-on-NVIDIA-GPUs GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/NERSC/roofline-on-nvidia-gpus). A few files were modified in order to be compatible with the metrics received from rocProf.

Directions on how to create a roofline model using the modified Python files are given as comments in the Python files. If there are any questions or clarifications needed, please feel free to create an issue.
